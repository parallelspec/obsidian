<h1>The Retrospective Korea ???</h1>

For my research assessment for the subject 'Contemporary Korea (KORE20002)' I have selected week six's topic of 'Korea's Rise as a Global Economic Power'. This topic (and thereforth my paper) shall delve into not only how Korea was able to achieve rapid economic growth but also compare North and South Korea's economic trajectory during the latter half of the twentieth century. I have chosen this topic as I have always found economic growth in Asian countries to be interesting to analyse; especially 'chaebols', and through my commerce degree background I am hopeful to illustrate the events that lead the nation torn apart by a civil war, to the economic and global powerhouse that South Korea is today to interested readers.

This topic is significant within Korea's history as this event helped propell

The structure of the paper is as follows: 

- Introduction of topic  
- Background information of Korea during the first half of the 20th century 
- Initial growth post Korea war 
- Peak growth of the Korean economy or, 'The Big Push'
- Financial crisis of the 1990s 
- Modern day (2010 onwards) Korea and the ramifications of the 'Miracle on the Han river'.
- Conclusion 


I have selected the following sources that will assist in the writing of this paper: 

*Lessons from Korean Economic Growth* by Susan M. Collins, 1990 

This paper discusses the strategies employed by the Korean government throughout the twentieth century through economic policies and investments that guided the nation to economic prosperity by the 1980s, the peak of South Korea's economic growth on a year-on-year metric. [citation] Collins is an American academic focusing on macroeconomics, and has written numerous works regarding economic growth in Asian countries, especially the 'Asian Tigers' and the BRIC nations.

*Demogrpahic change, human capital, and economic growth in Korea* by Jong-Suk Han, Jong-Wha Lee, 2020

*East Asian financial and economic development* by Randall Morck, Bernard Yeung (2017) 

This paper investigates the East Asian Tigers, a group of four countries that experienced turbulent growth through the late twentieth century. The two authors are both economists. In particular, Yeung lived a few years in Hong Kong, one of the cities tied with the East Asian Tigers.
