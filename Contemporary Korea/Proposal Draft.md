<h1>The Retrospective Korea ???</h1>

For my research assessment for the subject 'Contemporary Korea (KORE20002)' I have selected week six's topic of 'Korea's Rise as a Global Economic Power'. This topic (and thereforth my paper) shall delve into not only how South Korea (henceforth 'Korea') was able to achieve rapid economic growth but also compare Korea to other nations during the same time period, including North Korea. I have chosen this topic as I have always found economic growth in Asian countries to be interesting to analyse; especially 'chaebols', and through my commerce degree background I am hopeful to illustrate the events that lead the nation torn apart by a civil war, to the economic and global powerhouse that South Korea is today to interested readers.

This topic is significant within Korea's history as this event has changed Korea's standing in the world - from a third-world country to first-world within half a century. (Morck & Yeung, 2017 p. 2) Within the study of macroeconomics, Korea is an example of successful economic policies (Han and Lee, 2020, p. 1) being implemented. 

The structure of the paper is as follows: 

- Introduction of topic  
- Background information of Korea during the first half of the 20th century 
- Initial growth post Korea war 
- Peak growth of the Korean economy or, 'The Big Push'
- Financial crisis of the 1990s - in particular, the 1997 financial crisis
- Modern day (2010 onwards) Korea and the ramifications of the 'Miracle on the Han river'.
- Conclusion 


I have selected the following references that will assist in the writing of this paper: 

*Lessons from Korean Economic Growth* by Susan M. Collins, 1990 

This paper discusses the strategies employed by the Korean government throughout the twentieth century through economic policies and investments that guided the nation to economic prosperity by the 1980s. Collins is an American academic focusing on macroeconomics, and has written numerous works regarding economic growth in Asian countries, especially the 'Asian Tigers' and the BRIC nations.

*Demographic change, human capital, and economic growth in Korea* by Jong-Suk Han, Jong-Wha Lee, 2020 

This paper compiles the trends of human capital (labour and enterprise) within modern day Korea, and the changes caused by an increasing multicultural population. The two authors are both senior economists. In particular, Lee is the current professor of economics at Korea University, as well as formely being a senior economist advisor to Lee Myung-bak. Han is currently an associate professor of finance at the Stockholm School of Economics. The two were both born and raised in Korea during the peak industrisliastion and economic growth, giving insight in this topic through a native viewpoint. 

*East Asian financial and economic development* by Randall Morck, Bernard Yeung, 2017

This paper investigates the East Asian Tigers, a group of four countries that experienced turbulent growth through the late twentieth century, including Korea. The two authors are both economists. This paper along with the former (Han, Lee 2020) have the benefit of hindsight owing to their publish years. Yeung lived a few years in Hong Kong, one of the cities tied with the East Asian Tigers. 

*Where do high growth political economies come from? The Japanese lineage of Korea's "developmental state"* by Atul Kohli, 1994 

This paper focuses on the effects of Japanese colonialism upon Korea, and how it affected the political and economic decisions made by the Korean government the in subsequent half-century. Kohli is the professor of international affairs at Princeton University, focusing on the economies of developing nations. 

*Restructuring Korean Inc.* by Jang-Sup Shin and Ha-Joon Chang, 2003 

This book details the events leading up to, during, and post the 1997 Korean financial crisis. In particular, the section regarding chaebols will be used frequently within the assessment. The two authors are both Korean economists and professors - Shin at National University of Singapore, and Chang at the University of Cambridge.
