A Retrospective View of the Miracle on the Han River

Philip Phung 1046504

  

For my research assessment for the subject 'Contemporary Korea (KORE20002)', I have selected week six's topic of 'Korea's Rise as a Global Economic Power'. This topic (and thereforth my paper) shall delve into not only how South Korea (henceforth 'Korea') was able to achieve rapid economic growth (Collins, 1990 and Morck & Yeung, 2017) but also compare Korea to other nations during the same time period, including North Korea. 

  

This topic is significant within Korea's history as this event has changed Korea's standing in the world - from a third-world country to first-world within half a century. (Morck & Yeung, 2017 p. 2) Today, Korea is a part of the G20 and enjoys the benefits associated with being an advanced economy (Han & Lee, 2020). However, the journey towards this outcome was turbulent - in particular, the 1997 Asian financial crisis halted Korea’s GDP growth rates prior (Shin & Chang, 2003), and the effects of Japanese colonial rule remained remnant in Korea. (Kohli, 1994). 

  

The structure of the paper is as follows: 

  

- Introduction of topic 

- Background information of Korea during the first half of the 20th century 

- Initial growth post Korea war 

- Peak growth of the Korean economy or, 'The Big Push'

- Financial crisis of the 1990s - in particular, the 1997 financial crisis

- Modern day (2010 onwards) Korea and the ramifications of the 'Miracle on the Han river'.

- Conclusion 

  
  

I have selected the following references that will assist in the writing of this paper: 

  

Lessons from Korean Economic Growth by Susan M. Collins, 1990 

  

This paper discusses the strategies employed by the Korean government throughout the twentieth century through economic policies and investments that guided the nation to economic prosperity by the 1980s.

Demographic change, human capital, and economic growth in Korea by Jong-Suk Han, Jong-Wha Lee, 2020 

  

This paper compiles the trends of human capital within modern day Korea, and the changes caused by an increasing multicultural population. The two authors are both senior economists. In particular, Lee is the current professor of economics at Korea University, as well as formerly being a senior economist advisor to Lee Myung-bak. Han is currently an associate professor of finance at the Stockholm School of Economics. The two were both born and raised in Korea during the peak industrialisation and economic growth, giving insight into this topic through a native viewpoint. 

  

East Asian financial and economic development by Randall Morck, Bernard Yeung, 2017

  

This paper investigates the East Asian Tigers, a group of four countries that experienced turbulent growth through the late twentieth century, including Korea. The two authors are both economists. This paper along with the former (Han, Lee 2020) have the benefit of hindsight owing to their published years. Yeung lived a few years in Hong Kong, one of the cities tied with the East Asian Tigers.
