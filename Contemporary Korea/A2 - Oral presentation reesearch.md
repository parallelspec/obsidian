<h3>Introduction</h3> 

Hi, and welcome to my oral and visual presentation on BTS and what makes them Korean. NEXT SLIDE

To answer this question, we find out who BTS are - next slide 

BTS is a kpop group that debuted in 2013, but formed in 2010 - this is relatively common amongst KPOP groups
There are 7 members: RM, who is the leader, J-Hop, V, JungKook, Suga, Jimin and Jin. 
BTS stands for "Bangtan Boys" - Korean for 'Bulletproof Boy Scouts'. 
BTS is currently the best selling Korean music artist of all time, which was achieved in 2020 after their latest album *Map of the Soul - 7*. 

They have released two English only songs within the past 2 years - Dynamite, and Butter, both achieving momenutal success on the Billboard charts, the American music industry.

transition
we now talk about KPop

KPOP
KPOP, or Korean Pop, is a genre of music stemming from South Korea. It takes features of other genres into it - such as contemporary R&B, electronic dance music, and jazz just to name a few. In particular, we will be focusing on the hip-hop, R&B, and pop influences in this presentation as they are the main types of genres BTS uses in their songs. 

KPOP is thought to have started in the 90s, specfically via a band called Seo Taiji and Boys. This band is quite influential within the KPOP universe as they were one of the first groups to use elements of hip-hop, at the time an intriniscally American genre, in their songs.  DONT READ

it would not be until the 2000s when artists such as BoA and SHINee would popularise the KPOP we know today - a flashy and highly choreographed show with extravagant music videos and dance concepts. Note that BTS is not with any of these labels - they are with BigHit Entertainment.

focus slide
we will be focusing on the following to analyse how Korean BTS is: read off slide and transition to production 

The Big 3 Production
This is a table that lists the foreign producers, composers and choregraphers of each of the Big 3 companies. Considering that this table was created in 2012, this would have been the norm when BTS debuted in 2013 - with frequent production from American and Japanese composers and producers. When compared to the credits on BTS' Map of the Soul 7 album we can see they are following a similar trend - a large amount of foreign writers are on the album. It is important to note that most of the artists here come from an English speaking country - signifying the dominance of Western media within Korea.

With that being said, the majority of BTS' production since 2013 has been handled by its CEO Hitman and PDogg - both ethnically Korean. However we will need to delve more into what type of songs BTS makes to make a conclusion.  DONT READ

next slide bts and inspo
BTS is K-POP group who's initial focus was on hip-hop: both RM and Suga met each other in underground rap circles before they joined BTS, and j-hope was also (and still is!) a keen rapper. It is then little surprise that some of the inspirations BTS listed early on their career were all hip-hop artists - Nas, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar and Drake just to name a few. It is extremely important to note hip-hop is an intrinsitcally American musical genre - stemming from the African-Americans in the 1980s. 

BTS were also inspired by Korean acts - Epik High and Seo Taiji and Boys. These, whilst Korean, were both hip-hop artists inspired by Western music. Then again, perhaps the meaning of being Korean is changing - what does it mean to be Korean?  

In terms of music styles, BTS were hip-hop focused at the start of their careers, but have gradually shifted to a more pop-vibrant sound that fit better with the rest of the industry at hte time. According to Cho Hae-Joang, this move was done to become more popular within the global market and hence create more revenue. In the present day, Butter and Dynamite are both top hit pop records globally - a sign of success.

Lyrics
BTS is one of the few groups that actively write all their songs - one of the reasons why they are very popular. In particular, a song called Ddaeng, featuring J-Hope, RM and Suga features many Korean aspects, but formulated into a hip-hop song. The first lines of the song - One eight one three three eight, dANG! refer to a Korean card game called Seotda. Foreign listeners, even if they could understand the Korean language, would not neccessarily know what this line means if they did not know too much about Korean culture. This song in particular uses the multiple meanings of 'ddaeng'. In this scenario, 'ddaeng' means invincible or strong - as these combinations are considered to be the strongest in Seotda. This frog lyric references a Korean proverb - a frog stuck in the well cannot conceive the concept of an ocean. Again, western listeners would not understand this line unless they searched it up or had high Korean cultural knowledge.
Butter on the other hand is completely in English and references American culture - this line ... read it... features a double negative - "don't need no" here really just means "don't need" - but this is a common way of saying that in America. We thus conclude that BTS lyrics range from being quite Korean, and to being not so much Korean

Members
Whilst all of the members are Korean, their names here are not. RM used to stand for rap monster, Suga refers to shooting guard, a position in basketball, a western sport. The only 'Korean' names here are Jin, Taehyung and Jungkook. Within the industry, this is not entirely uncommon to have many members using non-Korean names - Blackpink, a girl group, only has one member use their Korean name. 

Music videos and perfromance
Spring Day, a song by BTS has a video which is often linked to the Sewol Ferry Tragedy. During the video, certain scenes feature the members in a boat - a ferry in particular. The lyrics themselves reference grief and the feeling of loneliness. However, BTS has stated numerous times that the lyrics of their songs, and the music videos and any performance is always up to the viewer to decide what it means to them. With that being said, Jin said "It is about a sad event, but also about longing"
