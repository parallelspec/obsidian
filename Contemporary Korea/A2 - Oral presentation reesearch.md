'How Korean is BTS'
- KPOP group, debuted 2013 (formed 2010). 7 members - Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jungkook 
- BTS stands for 'Bangtan Boys' - <i>Bulletproof Boy Scouts</i>, but later said it also stands for *Beyond the Scene*. 
- Originally a hip hop group, branched out to contempoary K-POP/pop and EDM. Released a Japanese album in 2014 
- First entirely English songs last year, <i>Dynamite</i> and <i>Butter</i> 
- By far the best selling artist in South Korean history.  
- All members awarded the *Order of Cultural Merit* - the *Hwagwan* (flower crown), 5th class. Notable awardees include that dude from Parasite and a famous ballerina 
- Influenced by a wide range of artists - from Seo Taiji and Boys to Nas to Charlie Puth to Queen. RM in particular was influenced by Epik High, a Korean hip-hop trio. 
- Albums seem to be inspired by a vast range of art - novels such as *Demian* and artworks like *The Lament for Icarus*.  
- Need to do a bit more research regarding any Korean influences other than Seo Taiji and Boys and Epik High.
