***Introduction*** to Aggreagate Output

National income accounts 
- accounting system
- used to measure AD/AS economic activity 


Key measures of AD/AS stuff
- GDP 
- GDI 
- By construction, GDP = GDI

These are all flow variables (varies... not stock!)

GDP:
- measure by total value of final goods and services produced (see: not intermediate!) 
- value-added approach (start from intermediate good, then subtract final good - intermediate good, then add the two)
	- e.g: steel $100, car $210, so $210 - $100 = 110, so value added: $100 + 110 = $210

GDI
- total income (wages and profits/losses) 

These are all merely a representation of economic activity, nothing more! Housework is considered an economic activity but it is very hard to put a figure on it! 

Nominal and Real GDP
nominal: Sum of quantity * current price
