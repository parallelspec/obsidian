<h3>Question 1</h3> 

a) inset png

b) Player 1 has 2 pure strategies, and player 2 has 2. 

c) The SPNE here is $\{b, bab\}$. That is, player 1 chooses to veto $b$, then player 2 at that information node chooses $a$, resulting in a pay-off of $(2,1)$. 

d) No. This can be shown via a game table associated with this game: 
$$\begin{pmatrix}  
X & 1,2 & 0,0\\  
\color{red}{2,1} & X & 0,0\\
2,1 & 1,2 & X
\end{pmatrix}$$
The first row depicts Player 1 vetoing $a$, and so on. The columns depict player 2 choosing the remaining two options. $X$ means that this option is not possible for player 2 to choose as player 1 as vetoed during their turn. For example, $(1,2)$ in the first row is the payoff associated with player 1 vetoing $a$, and player 2 choosing $b$. 

We can use cell-by-cell inspection to work out that the only NE payoff is $(2,1)$ in the first column, second row, highlighted in red. This is also the SPNE. 

<h3>Question 2</h3> 

a) The SPNE is $\{d, dd\}$. The payoff associated is $(6, 4)$. 

b)
